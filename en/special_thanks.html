<ul>
<li>Tested the app on five Android smartphones before its global release.</li>
<li>As a result, there was a phone that did not launch the app, so he identified the cause by disguising it as a armv7 architecture, installing it & checking the output logs using LogCat 😳</li>
<li>Tell us that the reason why the audio of recorded Zundamon cannot be played on some models is due to the standard file manager application, and recommended us free & no ad file manager app.</li>
<li>Told us that saving is not possible on some Android 10 devices. (And also provided with a solution, so we plan to fix it as soon as we acquire an Android 10 device)</li>
